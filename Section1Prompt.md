I'm preparing for a Java developer job assessment and want to master Core Java (Section 1 of the markdown I'm about to provide) by applying it in a **realistic project**, not isolated examples.

Please do the following:

✅ Build a **real Java project** based on this scenario:

The full markdown is in this project communityApp\java_spring_boot_preparation_plan.md
The comunityApp functionalities are in communityApp\ComunityAppFunctionalities.md


> A system called `communityApp` that helps manage a residential community. It tracks residents (name, email, apartment number), services (e.g., cleaning, maintenance), and allows storing and retrieving this data in memory. There's no database — just objects, lists, and collections. It should simulate simple operations like registering a resident, listing residents, searching by apartment, handling exceptions for duplicates, and so on.

✅ Apply and demonstrate **all the Core Java concepts** listed in **Section 1** of the markdown I'm providing:
- Variables and types
- Control flow
- OOP (inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces, etc.)
- Exceptions
- Collections
- Generics
- Java 8 features (Streams, lambdas, etc.)

✅ Structure the code with **best-practice folder layout** (like `model/`, `service/`, `util/`, etc.), even if it's a console-based Java app.

✅ Each file/class should be real and runnable (Java 17), with clean naming, Javadoc or inline comments for explanations, and light main method orchestration to simulate app behavior.

✅ Do not generate unrelated sections from the markdown — focus **only on Section 1: Core Java** and how to demonstrate each topic **inside the context of this community management app**.

My goal is to copy, run, modify, and learn Core Java deeply through a real-world example.
